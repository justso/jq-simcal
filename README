    It was hard finding a ultra minimal but jquery based plugin.
    I found a lot of abandoned projects and overly complex Web1.0 stuff.
    This looks like the best starting point.

simple jQuery date-picker plugin

last updated 3/12/09

Here's a nifty little date picker, but it's not complete.
In fact, it may need YOUR help.

All the code here is original. I have to thank Mike Alsup for suggesting
the development pattern that helped this go from one-off simple script
to ready-to-use jQuery plugin.

You're welcome to use anything here as often as you like,
even to include it as part of commercially release products.
Please don't package and sell it as a standalone application.

What is does:
 *  works on one or more text input elements (<input type="text" ... />)
 *  highlights a preset date (first looking for a value in the input,
    then a passed option / default, then just selects today)
 *  closes when either a date is picked, the "today" button is hit,
    or the "close" button is hit
 *  allows fast navigation using a <select> field for months and years
 *  advances and reverses months with a hit of the « or » buttons
 *  automatically hides the « or » buttons when either the start
    or end of the date range is reached
 *  allows input for a year range and/or a date range
 *  adjusts for leap years
 *  allows you to set the x and y offset from the top left corner
    of the input elements
 *  allows you to easily change the output format (look for
    "jQuery.fn.simpleDatepicker.formatOutput = function (dateObj) {...")
 *  is easily styled via CSS
 *  works in IE 6, FF 3 (probably earlier) and Chrome 1.0 (and probably
    others... just don't have them here on my laptop)

It is meant to NOT be an "everything-under-the-kitchen-sink" date picker.
Just there to help a user pick a date.

How to use it:
Simply call
    $('input').simpleDatepicker();
on the set of elements you would like to work with.

Options
You can pass an object literal with some options that will be applied to all
the datepickers setup with that call to simpleDatepicker()

    $('input')
    .simpleDatepicker({chosendate: , startdate: , enddate: , x: , y: });

an integer, without quotes is fine, like so: { x: 6, y: 10 }
options         values
[chosendate]    date string matching mm/dd/yyyy or m/d/yyyy
[startdate]     4 digit year or date string matching mm/dd/yyyy or m/d/yyyy
[enddate]       4 digit year or date string matching mm/dd/yyyy or m/d/yyyy
[x]
[y]
